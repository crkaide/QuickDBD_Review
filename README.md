# QuickDBD Recommendation
## Review of https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

### I was introduced to QuickDBD in a data analytics course, and in the field, have found it to be my first resource for presenting clear database connections to non-technical audiences.  It helps me organize my own thinking, and using its free tier (10 tables) led me to the Pro tier to create a project-wide overview of data connections and sources for a large multi-institutional project.  Love QuickDBD!!!
